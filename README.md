# Android Quotes App - Kotlin

# Overview

This application is a downloadable app built in Android Studios using Kotlin. The user can pick from three buttons to show spiritual quotes from their book of choice. There are currently three books' quotes included: The Book of Mormon, The KJV Bible, and the Quran.

This is an app I want for myself. I was hoping to integrate some sort of notification that would go off at timed intervals, alerting the user of a random scripture from the book they chose. There are a few apps close to that, but if I could choose how often I was notified of a great scripture, I think it would maximize how often I'd be able to see it.
